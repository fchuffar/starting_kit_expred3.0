# starting_kit_expred3.0

The challenge provides 2 data.frames (data_test and data_train, see below) of low grade glioma samples described by sex, age, histology, genes expression and DNA methylation values (multi-omics). The goal of this challenge is to predict the expression of the first gene (ALS2). The gene expression values are log normalized : r log2(DESeq2_normalized(raw_counts) + 1)

This challenge aims to use statistical or machine learning models (e.g. linear models, support vector machines) to predict the expression of the first gene using provided multi-omics and clinical observations.
